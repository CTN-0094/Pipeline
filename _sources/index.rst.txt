DAB Pipeline documentation
==========================

Welcome to the documentation for the Detecting Algorithmic Bias (DAB) Pipeline.  
This tool was designed to help researchers and developers examine bias in clinical datasets through customizable preprocessing, modeling, and analysis workflows.

**Coming Soon:**

This site will host tutorials, developer guides, model explanations, and walkthroughs for running the pipeline to detect bias in clinical datasets. Itâ€™s designed for both researchers and engineers.
